The ChatBot app was created as a Porfolio Project #3 (Python Essentials) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute. It allows the user to ask questions about anything to the my very own bot. The questions and answers are stored locally during the session and the user also has the option to store the chat logs in a Google Spreadsheet

## Project
### Strategy/Scope
I wanted to take the opportunity to dive into the world of LLM's and to use the time to learn a bit more about how to implement it into my own projects. 
ChatBot allows the user to use my application to ask whatever question they may have, and get intelligent responses via API from OpenAi's ChatGPT. Furthermore the user has the option to store the questions and answers from the current session into a Google Spreadsheet and to access and delete them if the user wants.

To achieve the strategy goals I implemented the following fueatures:
- Clean user interface for easier navigation and readability
- Use of colors in terminal to increase readbility
- A quick and smooth connection to database with Google
- A well designed terminal display for best experience

### Site owners goals
My goal as a developer for this project is to:
- Create an application that has a real life usage
- Create an application that is intuitive
- Create an application that is easy and fun to use
- Create an application that give clear and proper feedback for both valid and invalid input
- Create an application that is free from bugs
- An above all create an application that works as a good foundation for further improvements as the developers knowledge of both programming in general and knowledge of the OpenAi library increases.
- 
### External user's goal
As a user of the application I would like to:
- Immediately understand what the application should be used for
- To understand how the application works without great effort
- To easily access the features of the application
- To receive feedback when input is given
- To be able to exit
- Have a fun experience while using the program
- No bug encounters
-
